    For keyboard addition or changes, Vial will accept keyboards that implement "default" and "via" keymaps.
    For Vial-enabled keymaps please ensure that VIAL_INSECURE is not set.

    User keymaps (i.e. https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk/tree/vial/users) will not be accepted at the moment.

    For other core changes, please explain what you are changing and why.

    Before submitting a PR, delete the entirety of this comment and document your changes.
